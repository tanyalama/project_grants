This PR proposal written in collaboration with the State of Maine (Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife) was successfully funded in 2015. 
We included graduate stipend support for my doctoral dissertation, as well as funds for a species specific reference genome (Canada lynx) and low-coverage whole genome resequencing for ~75 individuals. 

The Canada lynx reference genome is a product of the Vertebrate Genomes Project Phase I initiative.
