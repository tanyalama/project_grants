In response to Emma's questions, I've compiled another folder with some information re: Multistate Conservation Grant proposals. 

Overview: https://www.fishwildlife.org/afwa-informs/multi-state-conservation-grants-program
1. Proposal must address 2021 AFWA strategic priorities (see doc)
2. $100,000 minimum. Project length up to 3 years
3. The first step would be to prepare a letter of intent. If accepted, full proposals would be due in August 2021. (see guidelines)
