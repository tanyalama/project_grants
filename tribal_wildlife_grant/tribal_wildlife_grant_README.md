I haven't applied for a TWG yet, but I'm interested in submitting a proposal in the future. 
I've included a couple resources in this repo, including previously funded project descriptions and a past call for proposals that addresses many common questions about tribal wildlife grants and how to submit a proposal

If you'd like to partner with me on a proposal please reach out! tanya.m.lama@gmail.com
